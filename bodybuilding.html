        Bodybuilding is an activity where people develop their muscles. It is a form of human body change which uses intensive muscle hypertrophy. Types of exercise workout routines that bodybuilders do include a full-body workout and a split workout.
An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders display their physiques to a panel of judges, who assign points based on their appearance.
The muscles are revealed through a process known as the "cutting phase" - a combination of fat loss, oils, and tanning which, combined with the lighting, make the definition of the muscle group more distinct.

        Bodybuilders train their body and then they pose when the competition starts. Bodybuilders do not show their power or strength. They only show their muscular body. It is important to have every muscle build up. The person with the best muscles and pose will win the contest. When Bodybuilders train they use very complex diet[1] and training systems that will help them to achieve best results.
